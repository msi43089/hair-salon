          Hi Bronde Babe! Welcome to Bronde Soceity Hair Co. We are located
          inside Strand Salon Studios Suite 6 in Pier Village. My name is Jess
          and I am the owner and stylist behind all of the hair pics. I am a
          second generation hair stylist with over 10 years of experience in the
          industry. My love for hair started as a child since many of my
          Saturdays were spent at the salon with my mom growing up. From a young
          age I was determined to get into hair school and open my own salon. In
          Spring of 2023 I finally decided to make my dreams a reality and
          opened Bronde Society Hair Co (with lots of help and support from my
          better half). When coming up with the name for my new salon, I really
          wanted it to reflect the services I offer and what I am most
          passionate about- Blondes and Brondes. I specialize in blonding,
          balayage, and bronde color melts. When Iâ€™m not behind the chair you
          can find me running around with my two year old daughter (Arlowe),
          running my clothing boutique (Arlowe + Jade), or snuggled up on the
          couch with a glass of Cabernet. I wanted to start Bronde Society to be
          able to give my clients a tranquil environment while getting the best
          hair of their life. Come check us out for yourself and see what all
          the talk is about! Xoxox
