                <p className="review-body">Jess is a boss when it comes to hair. She has done a variety of things for me. Haircuts, highlights, shadow roots, color corrections, balayage and so many other things I canâ€™t remember. She takes her time and actually explains the process and lets me know what to expect. I listen to her recommendations on shampoo/ conditioner and other hair products. She also has so much positive energy and it makes your time in her chair very enjoyable.</p>

She also genuinely cares about her clients and she has become a good friend over the years. I would never trust anyone else with my hair! She is also very knowledgeable about hair products and recommends the best hair lines that are also affordable. Highly recommend going to see her.</p>
